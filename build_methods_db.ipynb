            "Method: To solve this problem, first determine the total votes needed to win (just over 50% of 200 students, which is 101 votes). Next, calculate the number of boys and girls (60% and 40% of 200, respectively). Then, compute the votes June receives from boys (67.5% of the boys). Subtract this from the total votes needed to find the required votes from girls. Finally, divide this number by the number of girls to find the proportion, convert to percentage, and ensure it reflects the minimum needed to win. Common mistakes include miscalculating the threshold (using 100 instead of 101), errors in percentage calculations (like 200 * 0.6 = 120), or incorrect vote subtraction/division (e.g., 101 - 81 = 20, 20/80 = 0.25). Another pitfall is misunderstanding that the calculated percentage represents the minimum required proportion, not an average, and confusing this with overall vote share.\n",

Son olarak, tüm para türlerinin toplam değerleri eklenir. Önemli olan, her bir para türünün değerini (quarter: $0.25, dime: $0.10, nickel: $0.05, penny: $0.01) doğru uygulamak ve çarpma/toplama işlemlerinde dikkatli olmaktır. Yaygın hatalar arasında para değerlerini unutmak, yanlış çarpmak veya ondalıklı sayıları toplarken virgül kaydırmayı ihmal etmek bulunur.

            "Method: The solution employs a step-by-step incremental calculation pattern. It starts with the given first page (5 drawings), applies the common difference (increase by 5) to find subsequent page counts, and accumulates these values cumulatively to compute running totals. The pattern involves breaking the problem into smaller, sequential sub-problems: determining each page's drawing count individually, then summing them cumulatively. This method leverages the arithmetic sequence nature (first term 5, common difference 5) by generating terms and sums iteratively, reusing intermediate results efficiently. Similar problems often involve arithmetic sequences, cumulative sums over a range, or sequences with constant differences, where step-by-step computation builds the solution incrementally.\n",

It then isolates the cost of the related fruits by subtracting the known cost from the total ($66 - $6 = $60). The key insight is recognizing the equivalence '1 watermelon = 4 apples' to express watermelon cost in terms of apples (1W = 4A). Substituting this into the equation for the remaining cost (12W + 12A = $60) transforms it to 12(4A) + 12A = 48A + 12A = 60A = $60, solving for A = $1 per apple.

First, the 20% cut is calculated using direct proportion: 20/100 * 400. This step establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship between the number cut and the initial tree count. Second, the planting follows a defined ratio (5 new trees per cut tree), demonstrating multiplicative proportionality. Finally, the total is found by summing the remaining trees (400 - 80) and the new trees (80 * 5) using the associative property (320 + 400). The entire process adheres to the fundamental mathematical rule that operations on quantities preserve their relationships and can be combined sequentially to find new totals.\n",

            "Method: The solution relies on the concept of an arithmetic series. The sequence of drawings per page forms an arithmetic progression where each term increases by a constant difference (here, 5 drawings per page). The first term is 5 drawings on page 1. The sum of the first n terms of such a series follows the formula \\( S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (2a_1 + (n-1)d) \\), where \\( a_1 \\) is the first term, \\( d \\) is the common difference, and \\( n \\) is the number of terms. For the first five pages, \\( n = 5 \\), \\( a_1 = 5 \\), and \\( d = 5 \\). Plugging these values into the formula gives \\( S_5 = \\frac{5}{2} \\times (2 \\times 5 + (5-1) \\times 5) = \\frac{5}{2} \\times (10 + 20) = \\frac{5}{2} \\times 30 = 75 \\). The step-by-step calculation in the solution mirrors this by computing each page's drawing count (5, 10, 15, 20, 25) and summing them, which is equivalent to applying the arithmetic series sum formula directly.\n",

This leverages the distributive property and associative properties of arithmetic. The resulting values for each pile type are then summed using the addition principle, as monetary totals are additive. This approach efficiently handles the aggregation of identical items across multiple groups by reducing the problem to scalar multiplications and a single summation.\n",

This allows expressing the watermelon's price (W) in terms of the apple's price (A) as W = 4A. The equal distribution of 36 fruits among three types confirms 12 units of each. The cost of oranges ($6) is subtracted from the total bill ($66) to isolate the combined cost of apples and watermelons ($60). Substituting W = 4A into the equation 12W + 12A = 60 simplifies to 12(4A) + 12A = 60, which reduces to 60A = 60, directly solving for A = 1. This demonstrates solving a system of equations using substitution based on a given ratio.\n",
